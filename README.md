# NLP-Cuneiform
Uses Natural Language Processing to make a prediction about a cuneiform document
Made for CS4765 Natural Language Processing

Likely course of action:
Use ORACC as dataset
Use Nuolenna github.com/tosaja/Nuolenna to convert xml transliterations to unicode
Benchmark our classifier with max(P(c))
Experiment with various different models as time permits: Naive-Bayes, Linear Regression, SVM, KNN,
 some sort of Neural Net, "Random Forest", etc. Write a comparison of methods, how we tweaked things
 
Classify based on Legal Genre.
TODO: 
- Check ORACC for genre labels.
- Figure out using Nuolenna and tokenizing to get nice documents out of the dataset.
