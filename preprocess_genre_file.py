import subprocess

# Take in an ATF file, split it into several temporary files by document
# or maybe modify Nuolenna to add in these markers in the unicode file it makes?
# Maybe this is unnecessary and we should go by lines in a document?

# Run each document by Nuolenna

# Combine the results into a single file

# Based on User Input in the argument, generate a file of class labels
# To go the with the combined file
